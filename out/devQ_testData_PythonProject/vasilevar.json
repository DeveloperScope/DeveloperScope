The AclRemove view (accesslist/views.py) allows deletion of ACL objects via POST, but does not enforce authentication, authorization, or CSRF protection. This is a real HIGH severity security issue, as it allows unauthenticated or unauthorized users to delete records by simply knowing the UUID.\n\n2. The act view (accesslist/views.py) allows modification of ACL activities without any authentication or authorization checks. This is also a HIGH severity issue, as it allows anyone to modify sensitive data without restriction.\n\nOther reported issues were of lower severity or not security-critical, so they are omitted from this review.",
