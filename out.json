    "hiddenReasoning": "The new function 'json_from_string' uses Python's eval() to parse user-provided strings as JSON, which is extremely dangerous. The eval() function executes arbitrary code, so if a user provides a malicious string, it could lead to arbitrary code execution. This is a critical security vulnerability. The correct approach would be to use the standard library's json.loads() for parsing JSON safely. The README does not mention this function, so there is no documentation update or warning about the risk.",
